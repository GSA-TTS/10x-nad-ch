# 2. Use Python as primary language

Date: 2023-10-05

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Development of the 10x National Address Database Submission Tool (NAD-ST) is starting up, and we need to determine a programming language to use.

## Decision

We will use Python as the primary development language for this project.

## Consequences

- **Dependency Management**: We will use `poetry` to manage our Python dependencies.

- **Version**: We'll start with Python 3.11 and ensure that all developers use the same version to maintain consistency.
