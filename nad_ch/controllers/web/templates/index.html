<h1>Welcome to the NAD Collaboration Hub</h1>

<p>
  The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) and its partners from all levels
  of government recognize the need for a National Address Database (NAD).
  Accurate and up-to-date addresses are critical to transportation safety and
  are a vital part of Next Generation 9-1-1. They are also essential for a broad
  range of government services, including mail delivery, permitting, and school
  siting. To meet this need, USDOT partners with address programs from state,
  local, and tribal governments to compile their authoritative data into the
  NAD.

<p>
  Release 15 of the NAD, containing 76.8 million records, is now available for
  download from the link at the top left of this page.

<p>
  The National Address Database (NAD) has been working from the same schema
  since 2017. That schema was loosely based on the National Emergency Number
  Association (NENA) Next Generation 9-1-1 address standard and the Federal
  Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) Address Data Content Standard. Since then,
  the Address Content Subgroup of the Address Subcommittee of the FGDC has
  compiled content requirements for the NAD, and the NAD is in the process of
  migrating and transitioning to a new schema to align with these content
  requirements. Guidance for the latest schema will be provided here in the near
  future.
