    The 10x team is piloting the National Address Database Collaboration Hub

    Island's Geospatial Information Services Division.

    This product will provide a platform for State, Local, Tribal, and
    Territorial (SLTT) and federal data administrators to connect, collaborate,
    and share data in an efficient, streamlined manner—enabling a more complete
    and authoritative public domain address list to aid federal agencies with
    emergency and disaster response, location data sharing, and reduction of
    duplicative efforts—all while saving tax-payer dollars.
